# Sex distribution and their impact over population gene fitness.
I have the theory that one of the key reasons why sex distribution across most of the species tends to be 50% 50% is because it increases the population's fitness.

So I decided to create a quick (no research-based) proof of concept.

Turns out that a 50% 50% distribution of sex increments the fitness, but by a very small margin.

I think it worth exploring it deeply
